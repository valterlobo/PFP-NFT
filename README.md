# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```




npx hardhat run scripts/nft/1-upload-img.js
npx hardhat run scripts/nft/2-gerar-json.js
npx hardhat run scripts/nft/3-upload-json.js


npx hardhat run scripts/nft/4-deploy.js  --network mumbai
